# pwlistgen - written in python
**pwlistgen** is a password list generator for numerical passwords, with a length of your choice.
## Requirements
The only thing you need is to **install Python** (and of course **`pwlistgen.py`**) on your PC in order to execute the code. This works on all operating systems, so head over to https://www.python.org/download and install Python for your OS of choice.
## Preparation
Since the installation of Python is done, open your cmd and refer to the path where `pwlistgen.py` is located (starting from your **home directory**):
```cmd
cd thePath/pwlistgen/isLocated
```
Or in my case:
```cmd
cd Desktop/pwfolder
```
## Executing
Now that you are in the folder where you've installed **pwlistgen**, type:
```cmd
py pwlistgen.py > yourFileName.xy
```
Or in my case:
```cmd
py pwlistgen.py > pwlist.txt
```
PS: If `py` doesn't work try to type `python` instead.
